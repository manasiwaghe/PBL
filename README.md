Digitizing a college canteen involves leveraging technology to enhance various aspects of the canteen operations, improve students' overall experience, and automate the current manual system. There is a long line in the college cafeteria throughout the breaks. From the wait at the payment desk to the serving point, a lot of time is spent waiting for the food. Hence the students and faculty get late for their lectures. With an online ordering system or mobile app, students can browse the menu, select required items, and place their orders without waiting in long queues. Thus, remarkably reducing the time spent in line, leading to a faster ordering process. Our project uses OTP and UPI linked to our website with the help of APIs. People can order food on the website and receive an OTP. This OTP is shown at the counter to get the respective order. The website will be created using Python for the back end i.e., the server-side of the website, handling the behind-the-scenes operations, data storage, and business logic, and JavaScript, CSS, and HTML for the front end which focuses on the visual and interactive elements of a website that users directly interact with.
